# TorWAL

Previously known as `window-activity-logger`, but as a friend pointed out, `TorWAL` was more fitting.

Yeah, so this is my Window Activity Logger (WAL, not an overload term at all!) - a tool to collect and make stats of your windows use (in Linux).

## Example

```bash
$ torwal stats --since 2021-09-01 --before 2021-10-01

## How it works

I personally use this for tracking work hours.

Each 10 seconds, or for each _tick_, I save a row in a SQLite3 database with
the title of the currently active window on and for how long I've been
inactive.

A tick counts as active time if you have been idle for less then `IDLE_TIME` (I
use 5 min). If I attend a virtual meeting I use slightly higher thresholds, as
virtual meetings tend to lead to some inactivity (from your window managers
point of view).

Post-pandemic feature; IDLE_TIME is ignored for active time if I'm connected to
the office WiFi.

I personally check if Slack is running, as a signal to whether I'm «working» or
not. If i close Slack, i don't register active time. This is configurable.
This has the side effect of making me more mindful about closing work related
programs when I'm actually not working.


## Usage

### Register a tick

    ./wal.py reg

### Stats

    ./way.py stats [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--limit 20]

## Support

The standard config and implementation does only support Linux and X window
system, but feel free to add support for others, see [this
interface](https://github.com/torvald/TorWAL/blob/main/wal/system.py).

## Installation

Requires python 3.5 or newer.

Only standard python libraries are in use, so no need for virtual envs. To get
started:

    cp config.py.example config.py
    vim config.py
    ./wal.py

Crontab only have minutes as its smallest unit, and I wanted to collect data
every 10th second. I could make it into a running daemon, but this was just the
simplest way about:

    crontab -e

and add

    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    * * * * * sleep 0; [/path/to/modern/python] /path/to/folder/wal.py reg
    * * * * * sleep 10; [/path/to/modern/python] /path/to/folder/wal.py reg
    * * * * * sleep 20; [/path/to/modern/python] /path/to/folder/wal.py reg
    * * * * * sleep 30; [/path/to/modern/python] /path/to/folder/wal.py reg
    * * * * * sleep 40; [/path/to/modern/python] /path/to/folder/wal.py reg
    * * * * * sleep 50; [/path/to/modern/python] /path/to/folder/wal.py reg

To keep it more accessible i carry this alias in my .bashrc

    alias torwal="/path/to/folder/wal.py"
